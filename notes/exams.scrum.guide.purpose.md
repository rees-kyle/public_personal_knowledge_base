We **developed** Scrum in the *early* `1990s`. We wrote the **first version** of the *Scrum Guide* in `2010` to **help** people worldwide `understand` Scrum. We have **evolved** the guide since then through *small*, *functional* `updates`. Together, we stand behind it.

The Scrum Guide **contains** the `definition` of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is **essential** to the *overall* `value` and `results` realized with Scrum. **Changing** the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it `useless`.

We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the **word** “`developers`” in Scrum not to exclude, but **to** `simplify`. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.

As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.
