The Sprint is a container for all other events. **Each event** in Scrum is a formal `opportunity` **to** `inspect` and `adapt` **Scrum** `artifacts`. These **events** are specifically **designed** to enable the `transparency` required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to **create** `regularity` and to **minimize** the need for `meetings` not defined in Scrum.

Optimally, **all events** are held at the `same time` and `place` **to** `reduce complexity`.
