## People

Of the `thousands` **of** `people` who have `contributed` **to** `Scrum`, we should single out those who were `instrumental` **at the** `start`**:** `Jeff Sutherland` **worked with** `Jeff McKenna` **and** `John Scumniotales`, and `Ken Schwaber` **worked with** `Mike Smith` **and** `Chris Martin`, and `all` **of them `worked together`. Many others contributed in the ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined as it is today.

## Scrum Guide History

`Ken Schwaber` **and** `Jeff Sutherland first co-presented` **Scrum at** the `OOPSLA Conference` **in** `1995`. It essentially `documented` **the** `learning` that Ken and Jeff gained **over the** `previous few years` **and made** `public` **the** `first formal definition` **of** `Scrum`.

The `Scrum Guide` **documents** `Scrum` **as** `developed`, `evolved`, and `sustained` **for** `30-plus years` by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. `Other sources` **provide** `patterns`, `processes`, and `insights` **that** `complement` **the** `Scrum framework`. **These may** `increase productivity`, `value`, `creativity`, and `satisfaction` **with the** `results`.

The `complete history` **of** `Scrum` **is** `described elsewhere`. To honor the `first places` **where** it was `tried` **and** `proven`, we recognize `Individual Inc.`, `Newspage`, `Fidelity Investments`, and `IDX` (**now** `GE Medical`).
