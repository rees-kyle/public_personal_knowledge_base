A personal knowledge base refers to a **collection** of `information` and `knowledge` that an **individual** `gathers` and `organises` for their personal use. It serves as a repository of knowledge, insights, and notes on various topics of interest to the individual.

A PKB can take various forms, depending on personal preferences and the nature of the information being stored. It could be a physical notebook or journal, a digital document or folder structure on a computer, or even specialized software designed for knowledge management.

The **purpose** of a personal knowledge base is to provide a centralized and easily accessible repository for `storing` and `retrieving` *information*. It allows individuals to capture ideas, insights, research findings, and other valuable information in a structured and organized manner. It helps in personal learning, `information` **management**, and **fostering** a `deeper understanding` of various subjects.

Many people use personal knowledge bases to store and organize information such as articles, research papers, notes from books, personal reflections, project documentation, to-do lists, and more. The structure and organization of a PKB vary from person to person, and it can be **continuously** `updated` and `expanded` *over time* as new information is acquired.

Overall, a personal knowledge base serves as a **valuable** tool for *personal* `growth`, *knowledge* `retention`, and *enhancing* `productivity` by providing a centralized resource for storing and accessing information relevant to an individual's interests and pursuits.
