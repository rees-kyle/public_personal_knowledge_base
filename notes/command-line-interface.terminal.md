In the context of a Command-Line Interface (CLI), a terminal refers to a `software application` that allows users to interact with the operating system and execute commands using text-based inputs. It provides a text-based interface where users can type in commands and receive text-based outputs from the system.

The terminal provides a way to interact with the computer through the command line, which is a text-based interface for issuing commands to the operating system. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons and buttons, users interact with the system by typing commands in the terminal.

Here are some key features and functionalities of a terminal in a CLI:

1. **Command Execution**: Users can type commands directly into the terminal and execute them by pressing the Enter key.

2. **Text Output**: After executing a command, the terminal displays text-based output, which could be the result of the command or any error messages.

3. **File System Navigation**: Users can navigate through the file system, list directories, and perform file operations (copy, move, delete, etc.) using various commands.

4. **Script Execution**: Users can create and execute scripts written in shell scripting languages like Bash, which allows automating tasks through a series of commands.

5. **Customization**: Users can customize the appearance and behavior of the terminal, such as changing colors, fonts, and setting aliases for frequently used commands.

6. **Command History**: The terminal keeps a history of previously executed commands, allowing users to navigate through it and re-run commands easily.

7. **Remote Access**: Terminals can be used to connect to remote servers through SSH (Secure Shell) and execute commands on those servers.

Overall, the terminal is a powerful tool for system administration, software development, and various other tasks, providing users with direct control over the computer through text-based commands.
