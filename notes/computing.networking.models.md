A network model refers to a general concept based on a [[graph]]. It is an application of graph theory. In computer networking, network models have a specific layered structure and are designed to facilitate the practical implementation of computer networks.

1. Purpose and Application: In computer networking, network models are used to design and describe the layered structure of computer networks. These models provide a conceptual framework to understand how data is transmitted, processed, and communicated across different network layers. The purpose is to facilitate interoperability and standardization in networking protocols and technologies.

2. Representation: In computer networking, nodes represent specific networking devices (e.g., routers, switches, computers), and edges represent the physical or logical connections between these devices, symbolizing data flow and communication paths.

3. Layers and Protocols: In computer networking, network models consist of layered structures, such as the OSI model or TCP/IP model, each layer responsible for specific functions and protocols. The layered approach allows for modular design, making it easier to develop, manage, and troubleshoot complex networks.

4. Emphasis on Practical Implementation: Network models in computer networking are practical and have a direct impact on the implementation of networking technologies, ensuring that different devices and systems can communicate effectively and efficiently.
