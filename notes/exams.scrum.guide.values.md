Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living `five` **values**:

`Commitment`, `Focus`, `Openness`, `Respect`, and `Courage`

The **Scrum Team** `commits` to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary `focus` is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The **Scrum Team and** its **stakeholders** are `open` about the work and the challenges. **Scrum Team** members `respect` each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The **Scrum Team** members have the `courage` to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members **learn and explore** the values as they work **with** the `Scrum events` and `artifacts`. When these **values** are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical `Scrum pillars` of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
