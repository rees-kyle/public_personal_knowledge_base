A command-line interface (CLI) is a `text-based method` of interacting with a computer's operating system or software applications through typed commands in a terminal or command prompt. In a CLI, users enter specific commands, each consisting of a command keyword and optional parameters or arguments, followed by pressing the "Enter" or "Return" key to execute the command.

Key characteristics of a command-line interface include:

- **Text-Based Interaction:** CLI operates entirely through text input and output. Users type commands as text, and the system responds with text-based feedback or output.

- **Command Prompt:** When a user opens a `terminal` or command prompt, they are presented with a command prompt (a textual indicator) that signals the system is ready to accept commands.

- **Commands and Parameters:** Users type commands, and each command may accept additional parameters or arguments to modify its behavior.

- **Command Interpretation:** The CLI's command-line interpreter (also known as the `shell`) reads and interprets the user's input. It executes the corresponding actions or tasks based on the entered commands.

- **Flexibility and Power:** CLI provides advanced control over the operating system and software. It allows users to perform various tasks, manage files and directories, run programs, configure system settings, and more.

- **Scripting and Automation:** Commands entered in the CLI can be combined into scripts or batch files to automate repetitive tasks or create custom workflows.

CLI is a fundamental tool in computer systems, particularly in server administration, programming, system maintenance, and technical fields. While it may have a steeper learning curve compared to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), mastering the command-line interface offers greater efficiency, precision, and automation capabilities for experienced users and administrators.
