Here are some `techniques`:

- **Focus** on the *main* `ideas`, *key* `concepts`, or *central* `arguments` in the text. Highlight or underline the most important information that directly supports the main point or contributes to your understanding of the topic.

- **Assign** *different* `colours` or `symbols` to represent different types of information. For example, use one color for main ideas, another for supporting evidence, and a different color for definitions or examples. This visual distinction helps you quickly identify and categorize different types of information.

- **Avoid** `overuse` of *highlighting* and *underlining*. Instead, choose only the most essential information to mark. Highlighting or underlining everything may dilute the effectiveness and make it harder to distinguish key points.

- **Develop** a *consistent* `system` of highlighting or underlining that works for you. For example, you might choose to underline key ideas and use different colors for supporting details or examples. Consistency will help you easily interpret your markings during later review sessions.

- **Balance** between *highlighted* `text` and `white space`. Avoid excessive highlighting, which can make the page cluttered and harder to read. Leave some space to make your markings stand out and allow for easy visual scanning.

- **Highlight** `actionable` *information*. If the text contains actionable steps, instructions, or important details, highlight or underline them. This makes it easier to locate and follow those specific instructions later on.

- **Highlight** `definitions` of *important* `terms` or vocabulary words. This makes them stand out and helps you review and reinforce their meaning.

- **Use** the `markings` to **summarise** as you finish reading a section or chapter, reviewing your highlighted or underlined portions.

- **Avoid** *excessive* `reliance`. While highlighting and underlining can be helpful, they should not replace active reading and note-taking. Use these techniques as supplements to your understanding and engagement with the text, rather than relying solely on the markings.

- **Review** and **Reflect**: After reading, take the time to review and reflect on your `highlights` and `underlines`. Consider how they relate to each other, how they support the main ideas, and how they fit into the larger context of the text.

Remember, the purpose of highlighting and underlining is to *visually* **emphasize** *important* `information`, aid in comprehension, and provide a quick reference for later review. Use these techniques judiciously and adapt them to suit your own reading style and preferences.
