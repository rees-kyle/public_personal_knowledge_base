## Personal Knowledge Base

A personal knowledge base refers to a collection of information and knowledge that an individual gathers and organises for their personal use. It serves as a repository of knowledge, insights, and notes on various topics of interest to the individual.

A PKB can take various forms, depending on personal preferences and the nature of the information being stored. It could be a physical notebook or journal, a digital document or folder structure on a computer, or even specialized software designed for knowledge management.

The purpose of a personal knowledge base is to provide a centralized and easily accessible repository for storing and retrieving information. It allows individuals to capture ideas, insights, research findings, and other valuable information in a structured and organized manner. It helps in personal learning, information management, and fostering a deeper understanding of various subjects.

Many people use personal knowledge bases to store and organize information such as articles, research papers, notes from books, personal reflections, project documentation, to-do lists, and more. The structure and organization of a PKB vary from person to person, and it can be continuously updated and expanded over time as new information is acquired.

Overall, a personal knowledge base serves as a valuable tool for personal growth, knowledge retention, and enhancing productivity by providing a centralized resource for storing and accessing information relevant to an individual's interests and pursuits.

A particular area I am interested in is computing.
