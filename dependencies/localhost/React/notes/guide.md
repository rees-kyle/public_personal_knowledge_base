1. ~~**Introduction**~~

2. **React Basics**
   - JSX syntax
   - Components and props
   - State management in functional components

3. **Component Lifecycle**
   - Lifecycle methods (for class components)
   - Hooks (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)

4. **Hooks**
   - useState, useEffect
   - Custom hooks
   - useContext for global state management

5. **Routing**

   - Fetching data with fetch or Axios
   - Error handling and loading states

10. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoization with React.memo
   - useMemo and useCallback
   - Code splitting

11. **Testing**
    - Unit testing with Jest
    - Component testing with React Testing Library

12. **TypeScript with React**
    - Basic TypeScript concepts in React

13. **Deployment**
    - Deployment options (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

This should give you a solid foundation in React while avoiding redundant topics.
