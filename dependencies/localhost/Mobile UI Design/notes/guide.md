Since you already have a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS, JS, React, and React Native**, you can skip basic coding concepts and focus purely on **mobile UI design for Android**. I’ll structure the topics so you can progress without repeating what you already know:

---

### ~~**1. Android UI Principles & Guidelines**~~

* ~~Material Design fundamentals (color, typography, shapes, motion)~~
* ~~Android-specific design guidelines (Android Developers’ Material Design guidelines)~~
* ~~Understanding density-independent pixels (dp) and scalable pixels (sp)~~
* ~~Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes and resolutions~~
* ~~Accessibility design (contrast, touch targets, screen readers)~~

---

### ~~**2. Mobile UX Patterns**~~

* ~~Navigation patterns: bottom navigation, side drawer, tabs, gestures~~
* ~~Forms and input handling on mobile~~
* ~~Onboarding flows~~
* ~~Notifications and feedback mechanisms~~
* ~~Contextual actions and modal usage~~

---

### ~~**3. Layouts and Components (Android Focus)**~~

* ~~Common UI components: Buttons, Cards, Chips, Dialogs, Snackbar, AppBar~~
* ~~RecyclerView / ListView design patterns~~
* ~~ConstraintLayout and its design advantages~~
* ~~Scrollable layouts & handling long content~~
* ~~Animations and transitions (motion design)~~

---

### **4. Prototyping & Wireframing**

* Low-fidelity vs. high-fidelity wireframes
* Tools for UI/UX prototyping: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
* Creating interactive prototypes for testing
* Rapid iteration of design ideas

---

### **5. Advanced Design Concepts**

* Micro-interactions (animations, gestures)
* Dark mode and theme management
* Responsive/adaptive design for multiple devices
* Designing for performance (lightweight components, efficient rendering)

---

### **6. Design Handoff & Collaboration**

* Exporting assets for Android (SVG, PNG, 9-patch images)
* Spec documentation for developers
* Versioning design files and maintaining consistency (Design Systems)
* Integrating design with React Native components

---

### **7. Optional but Valuable**

* User research & testing (A/B testing, user flows)
* Motion design tools (Lottie for React Native animations)
* Iconography and typography design for mobile

---

💡 **Tip:** Since you already know React Native, you can combine Android UI design principles with React Native components and libraries like **React Native Paper** or **NativeBase**, which implement Material Design, so you’ll be designing practically while learning theory.
