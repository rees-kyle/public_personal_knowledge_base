Since you already know **HTML, CSS, JS, and React**, you can **skip** the fundamentals and focus specifically on what’s **unique to React Native**. Here's a curated list of **React Native-specific topics** to learn:

### React Native Topics for React Developers

1. ~~**Setup & Environment**~~
    - ~~Installing React Native CLI or using Expo~~
    - ~~Differences between Expo and React Native CLI~~
    - ~~Running apps on Android and iOS simulators/emulators~~

1.  ~~**Core Components**~~
    - ~~View, Text, TextInput~~
    - ~~ScrollView, FlatList, SectionList~~
    - ~~Button, Pressable, TouchableOpacity~~
    - ~~Image~~

1. ~~**Styling in React Native**~~
    - ~~Flexbox (similar to CSS but slightly different defaults)~~
    - ~~Stylesheet.create vs inline styles~~
    - ~~No CSS files — all styling is JavaScript objects~~
    - ~~Platform-specific styling (iOS vs Android)~~

1. ~~**React Navigation library**~~
    - ~~Stack Navigator~~
