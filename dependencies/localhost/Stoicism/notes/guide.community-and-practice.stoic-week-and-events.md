`Stoic Week` **is an** `annual event` **organized** `by the Modern Stoicism organization`, **designed** `to introduce` `people` `to Stoic philosophy and practice` **through** `guided` `exercises`, `readings`, **and** `daily reflections`. During Stoic Week, participants around the world engage in practical exercises based on Stoic principles, such as `journaling`, `meditation`, `and reflection` **on Stoic texts**. **The goal is** `to help` `individuals` `incorporate Stoic practices` `into their daily lives`, **thereby** `fostering` `personal growth` `and resilience`.


## Events and Activities:

- **Guided Exercises:** Each day of Stoic Week features specific exercises and reflections designed to help participants apply Stoic principles in their everyday lives. These exercises **may include** `mindfulness meditation`, `cognitive reframing`, **and** `journaling`.
- **Daily Themes:** The week is typically structured around daily themes `that focus on` `different aspects of` `Stoic philosophy`, **such as** `the dichotomy of control`, `dealing with emotions`, **or** `cultivating virtues` like wisdom, courage, and justice.
- **Readings and Reflections:** Participants are provided with `curated readings from` ancient Stoic texts like those of `Marcus Aurelius`, `Epictetus`, **and** `Seneca`. These readings are supplemented `with modern interpretations` `to make them more accessible and applicable` `to contemporary life`.
