The Dichotomy of Control is a `central tenet of` `Stoic philosophy` **that emphasizes** `distinguishing between` `what is` `within our control` `and what is not`. Understanding and applying this principle **can lead to a** `more serene` `and focused` `life`, **as it** `directs` `our energy` **towards what we can influence and helps us accept what we cannot**.

A tenet **is a** `principle or belief` **that is** `accepted as` `true`, **especially one that is a core** `part of a` **particular** `philosophy`, `religion`, `or system of thought`.

## Things We Can Control

- **Our Own Actions**:
   - **Decisions and Choices**: We have full control over the choices we make. This **includes our** `behaviors`, `responses` **to situations**, **and** `moral decisions`.
   - **Efforts and Endeavors**: The effort `we put into` **our** `work`, `relationships`, **and** `personal growth` is entirely up to us.

- **Our Attitudes**:
   - **Perceptions and Judgments**: `How we interpret` `and think about` `events and other people's actions` are under our control. `By` `adjusting` **our** `perceptions`, **we can** `maintain` **a** `balanced and rational` `perspective`.
   - **Emotional Responses**: While `initial emotions` **may be** `automatic`, `how we` `handle and process` **these** `emotions` **is within our control**. **Stoicism teaches** `techniques for` `managing emotions` `through reason and mindfulness`.

## Things We Cannot Control

- **External Events**:
   - **Natural Events**: Phenomena **like the** `weather`, `natural disasters`, **and the** `passage of time` **are beyond our influence**.

**The** `process or period` `of time` `going by`.

   - **Random Occurrences**: `Unexpected events`, **such as** `accidents` **or** `sudden changes` **in circumstances**, fall outside our control.

- **Other People's Actions**:
   - **Behavior of Others**: We cannot control how others behave, `their decisions`, **or their** `opinions`. `Attempting to do so` `often leads to` `frustration and conflict`.
   - **Opinions and Feelings of Others**: Just as we have control over our attitudes, others have control over theirs. `We can` `influence` `but not` `dictate` **how others feel or think**.

## Applying the Dichotomy of Control

- **Focus on Internal Goals**:
   - **Set Goals Based on Actions**: **Create goals that depend on your efforts and choices** `rather than` `outcomes that` `depend on` `external factors`. For **example**, **aim to do your best in a project rather than aiming solely for external recognition**.

- **Practice Acceptance**:
   - **Acceptance of External Events**: `Develop` **the** `habit of` `accepting things` **that are** `beyond` `your control`. This `doesn't mean` `passivity` `but` **rather a** `calm acknowledgment of` `reality`.



<!-- start of 'passivity' section -->

    <summary>Definition: passivity</summary>

#
Passivity **generally refers to a** `state of` `inactivity`, `inaction`, **or a** `tendency` `to accept or allow` `things to happen` `without` `active response or resistance`. It **can also describe** `a lack of` `assertiveness` **or a** `calm`, `submissive attitude`.

<details>
    <summary>Definition: assertiveness</summary>

#
Assertiveness **means** `expressing your` `thoughts`, `feelings`, `and needs` `confidently and respectfully`, `without being` `passive or aggressive`. It **involves** `standing up` `for yourself` `while respecting others`.

<!-- start of 'passive' section -->

    <summary>Definition: passive</summary>

#
Passive **means** `not taking action` `or showing little resistance`; **often** `accepting things` `as they are` `without` `active participation or response`.

- **Cultivate Virtue**:
   - **Moral Integrity**: `Prioritize` `virtue and ethical behavior in` `all actions`, `regardless of` `external outcomes`. **Stoics believe that** `living virtuously is` `the highest good` **and** `is always` `within` `our control`.

- **Mindfulness and Reflection**:
   - **Daily Reflection**: `Regularly reflect on` `what is within` `your control` `and what is not`. This **can be done through** `practices` **like** `journaling or meditation`, `reinforcing` `the Stoic` `mindset`.

## Conclusion

The `Dichotomy of Control` **is about** `recognizing` `our limits` `and focusing` `our efforts` where they can be most effectiveâ€”`on our own` `actions and attitudes`. By embracing this principle, **we can** `reduce unnecessary stress`, `improve our resilience`, `and live` `more fulfilling` `lives`.
