Use SQL to analyze a `database` containing information **about** `Transport` **for** `London journeys` **over** `12 years`!

> [notebook](<projects/Exploring London's Travel Network/notebook.ipynb>)


## Project Description

How do Londoners get around? Transport for London (TfL) is a vast public transport network that allows London's residents to efficiently travel around the UK's capital, to the tune of over `1.5 million` `journeys` **per** `day`!

In this introductory project, you will work with a `Snowflake`, `Amazon Redshift`, **or** `Google BigQuery` `database` containing `data` on journeys and transport types in London `between` `2010` **and** `2022`. You will write SQL queries to **find** the `most popular` `transport methods`, **examine** `when` **the** `Emirates Airline` `cable car` (which connects London's Royal Docks, where the Mayor's office is located, to Greenwich Peninsula, home of the O2 arena) **was** particularly `busy`, and **identify** `rare periods` **when the** `Underground` (also known as "the tube" to locals) **was** `less busy`.
