Database design is critical for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't build a house without a blueprint, `you need to plan how you’ll store your data beforehand`. In this interactive SQL track, you'll learn the fundamentals of database design and how to:

✓ Write basic `SQL queries`
✓ Group and aggregate data to produce `summary statistics`
✓ `Join tables` and `apply filters` and `sub-queries`
✓ Write `functions` to `explore` and `manipulate data`

Working with real-world datasets, gain the SQL skills you need to `query a database, analyze results, and effectively communicate your insights to stakeholders`. There’s no prior SQL knowledge required—start your journey to becoming a confident data analyst.
