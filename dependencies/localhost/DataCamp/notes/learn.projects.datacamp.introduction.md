## Project Description

This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. **DataCamp** `projects` `allow` **you to** `apply` the `skills` **you have** `learned` **in DataCamp** `courses`. In `each project`, you will carry out an `end-to-end analysis` **on** `real-world tasks` `using` `real-world tools` **and** `workflows`.

In doing so, **you will** `learn` how to work with `Jupyter notebooks`: an open-source web application that is `great` **for** `interactive` `data analysis`.


## Guided Projected

In this gentle introduction to DataCamp projects, we will walk you through the project interface!
