For end-to-end testing in JavaScript, Selenium and Puppeteer are two popular choices. Here's a brief overview of each:

#
End-to-end testing **means** `testing` **the** `whole` `application workflow` `from beginning` `to end`. It `checks if` `all parts of` **the** `system` `work together properly`, **from the user interface to the backend**. **This testing mimics real user actions to find and fix any issues that might arise from how the different parts connect**.

#
An application workflow **is the** `series of steps` `a user takes` `to do something` `in a software program`, **like** `signing in`, `searching for something`, **and then** `checking out`.

1. **Selenium:** Selenium is a widely-used `tool for` `automating` `web browsers`. It provides a `WebDriver API` that allows you `to interact with` `web elements` **on a webpage**. `Selenium supports` `multiple programming languages` **including JavaScript**. You can use **libraries like** `WebDriverIO` `to write tests` **in JavaScript** `and` `run them with` `Selenium WebDriver`.

2. **Puppeteer:** Puppeteer **is a** `Node.js library` **developed by Google**. **It** `provides` **a high-level** `API` `over` **the** `Chrome DevTools Protocol`, allowing you `to control` `Chrome or Chromium` `programmatically`. Puppeteer is known for its ease of use and powerful features, especially for testing and web scraping. It's particularly useful for headless browser testing.

<details>
  <summary>Definition: programmatically</summary>

#
"Programmatically" **refers to** `performing` `tasks or actions` `using code or programming instructions` `rather than` `manual interaction`. In other words, it **involves automating processes through software rather than relying on manual input or intervention**. When something is done programmatically, it **means that it is executed by a computer program or script according to predefined rules and logic**. This term is **commonly used in the context of software development and automation to describe actions performed by software rather than by humans**.

**Both** Selenium and Puppeteer **can be used for end-to-end testing of web applications**. Your `choice between them` **may** `depend on` **factors such as your** `familiarity` **with the tool**, specific `requirements` **of your project**, `and whether you need` `headless browser testing`.



<!-- start of 'headless browser testing' section -->
<details>
  <summary>Definition: headless browser testing</summary>

#
Headless browser testing **means** `testing websites` `without` `showing them on` **the** `screen`. It's handy `for automated testing` **and works faster than regular testing because it doesn't need to display the web page**.
