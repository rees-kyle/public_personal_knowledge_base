HTML validation is the `process` **of** `checking` **whether** a web page's HTML `code` **is** `well-formed` **and** `follows` the `rules` **and** `specifications` **defined by** the `HTML standard`. Valid HTML is essential for `ensuring` that **web pages are** `displayed correctly` **across** `different` `browsers` **and** `devices`.


## Tools

### W3C Markup Validation Service

The `World Wide Web Consortium` (W3C) provides a Markup Validation Service that allows you to input the URL of a web page or directly upload an HTML file for validation. It checks the HTML code against the W3C recommendations and provides a detailed report of any errors or warnings.

Website: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Browser Developer Tools

Most modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools that include HTML validation features. You can use the "`Inspect`" or "`Developer Tools`" `option` in your browser, navigate to the "`Console`" `tab`, and **look for** any HTML validation `errors` **or** `warnings`.

### IDEs and Code Editors

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and code editors often include `built-in features` or `plugins/extensions` for HTML validation. Examples include `Visual Studio Code`, Atom, and Sublime Text.

### Online Validators

There are several online HTML validators that allow you to `copy` **and** `paste` your HTML `code` directly into a web interface for validation. Examples include the W3C Markup Validation Service mentioned earlier, as well as other third-party services.

### Command-Line Tools

Some developers prefer using command-line tools for validation. For instance, you can use the `curl` **command along with** the `W3C Markup Validation Service API` to validate HTML from the command line.

#
When validating HTML, it's `crucial` **to** `address` any `errors` **or** `warnings` `reported` by the validator, as they can affect how the page is rendered in different browsers. Keep in mind that `validation` **is just** `one aspect` of creating a well-structured and accessible web page. `Other considerations` **include** using `semantic HTML`, `optimizing` for `performance`, **and ensuring** `compatibility` **with** various `devices` **and** `screen sizes`.
