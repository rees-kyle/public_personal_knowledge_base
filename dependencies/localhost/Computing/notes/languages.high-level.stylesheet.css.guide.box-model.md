The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a web page are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. It consists of the following components:

1. **Content:** This is the actual content of the box, such as text, images, or other media.

2. **Padding:** The padding is the space between the content and the border. It helps to create space within the element.

3. **Border:** The border surrounds the padding and content. It is optional, and you can define its style, color, and width.

4. **Margin:** The margin is the space outside the border. It creates space between the element's border and its surrounding elements.

Here's a visual representation:

```
+------------------------+
|        Margin          |
|   +----------------+   |
|   |    Border      |   |
|   |   +--------+   |   |
|   |   | Padding|   |   |
|   |   |        |   |   |
|   |   +--------+   |   |
|   |     Content    |   |
|   +----------------+   |
|                        |
+------------------------+
```

In CSS, you can set the dimensions and styles of these components using properties like `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`. Here's an example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid #333;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

In this example, the box will have a width of 200 pixels and a height of 100 pixels. It will have 20 pixels of padding, a 2-pixel solid border with a color of #333, and a margin of 10 pixels.

Understanding and mastering the box model is crucial for designing and laying out web pages effectively. It helps control spacing, sizing, and positioning of elements on the page.
