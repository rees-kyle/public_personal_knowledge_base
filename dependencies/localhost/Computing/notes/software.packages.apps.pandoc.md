Pandoc is a free and open-source `document converter software`. It is a `command-line tool` that allows you to convert files from one markup format to another. The supported input and output formats include various `document formats` like `Markdown`, `HTML`, `LaTeX`, `PDF`, `DOCX`, and many others.

Pandoc is versatile and widely used because it supports a large number of input and output formats, making it a valuable tool for writers, researchers, and anyone dealing with documents in different formats. It can be particularly useful for converting documents between different markup languages, allowing users to work with their preferred formats while still producing documents in other required formats.

Pandoc also supports a variety of options for more advanced customization and fine-tuning of the conversion process. If you are working with documents in different formats and need to convert them seamlessly, Pandoc can be a powerful and efficient tool in your toolkit.
