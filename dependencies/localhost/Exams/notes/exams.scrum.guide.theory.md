Scrum is **founded** on `empiricism` and `lean thinking`. Empiricism asserts that **knowledge** *comes from* `experience` and making **decisions** *based on what is* `observed`. Lean thinking **reduces** `waste` and **focuses** *on the* `essentials`.

Scrum employs an `iterative`, `incremental` **approach** to **optimize** `predictability` and to **control** `risk`. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combines `four` formal **events** for inspection and adaptation *within* a **containing event**, the [[Sprint|exams.scrum.guide.events.sprint]]. These events work because they implement the empirical **Scrum pillars** of `transparency`, `inspection`, and `adaptation`.

    <summary>Transparency</summary>

#
The emergent **process** and **work** must be `visible` **to those** `performing` the work `and receiving` the work. With Scrum, important **decisions** are based on the `perceived state` **of its** `three` formal `artifacts`. Artifacts that have **low transparency** can lead to decisions that `diminish value` and `increase risk`.

Transparency **enables** `inspection`. Inspection **without transparency** is `misleading` and `wasteful`.

    <summary>Inspection</summary>

#
The `Scrum artifacts` and the `progress` toward agreed goals must be **inspected** `frequently` and `diligently` **to** `detect` potentially undesirable `variances` or `problems`. To help with inspection, **Scrum** provides `cadence` **in** the form of its five   `events`.

Inspection **enables** `adaptation`. Inspection **without adaptation** is considered `pointless`. `Scrum events` are **designed** to `provoke change`.

<details>
    <summary>Adaptation</summary>

#
**If** any **aspects** of a `process` **deviate outside** acceptable `limits` **or** if the resulting **product** is `unacceptable`, the **process** being applied **or** the **materials** being produced must be `adjusted`. The **adjustment** must be made `as soon as possible` to `minimize` further **deviation**.

Adaptation becomes **more difficult** when the people involved are `not` empowered or `self-managing`. A `Scrum Team` is expected to **adapt** the **moment** it `learns` anything new **through** `inspection`.
