The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The **Scrum Team** consists of **one** `Scrum Master`, **one** `Product Owner`, and `Developers`. Within a Scrum Team, there are **no** `sub-teams` or `hierarchies`. It is a cohesive unit of professionals **focused on** one objective at a time, the `Product Goal`.

**Scrum Teams** are `cross-functional`, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are **also** `self-managing`, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.

The **Scrum Team** is `small` enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically `10` **or** `fewer` **people**. In general, we have found that **smaller teams** `communicate` **better** and are **more** `productive`. If **Scrum Teams** become too `large`, they should consider reorganizing into `multiple` cohesive **Scrum Teams**, each **focused on** the `same product`. Therefore, they should share the **same** `Product Goal`, `Product Backlog`, and `Product Owner`.

The Scrum Team is **responsible** for `all product-related activities` **from** `stakeholder collaboration`, `verification`, `maintenance`, `operation`, `experimentation`, `research` and `development`, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.

The entire Scrum Team is **accountable** for creating a valuable, useful `Increment` **every** [[scrum.guide.events.sprint]]. Scrum defines `three` **specific accountabilities** within the Scrum Team: the `Developers`, the `Product Owner`, and the `Scrum Master`.

    <summary>Developers</summary>

#
**Developers** are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to `creating` any aspect of a usable **Increment** each Sprint.

The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:

- **Creating** a `plan` for the Sprint, **the** `Sprint Backlog`;

- **Instilling** `quality` by **adhering to a** `Definition of Done`;

- `Adapting` their **plan** each day **toward** the `Sprint Goal`; and,

- **Holding each other** `accountable` as professionals.

    <summary>Product Owner</summary>

#
The **Product Owner** is accountable for `maximizing` the `value` of the **product** resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The **Product Owner** is also accountable for effective `Product Backlog` **management**, which includes:

- **Developing** and explicitly **communicating** the `Product Goal`;

- **Creating** and clearly **communicating** `Product Backlog items;

- **Ordering** `Product Backlog items`; and,

- Ensuring that the **Product Backlog** is `transparent`, `visible` and `understood`.

The `Product Owner` may do the **above work or** may delegate the responsibility to `others`. **Regardless**, the **Product Owner** remains `accountable`.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire `organization` must **respect their decisions**. These decisions are **visible in** the `content` **and** `ordering` **of** the **Product Backlog**, **and** through the inspectable **Increment** at the `Sprint Review`.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may **represent** the needs of many `stakeholders` in the **Product Backlog**. Those wanting to **change** the **Product Backlog** can do so by trying to `convince` the **Product Owner**.

    <summary>Scrum Master</summary>

#
The Scrum Master is accountable for **establishing** `Scrum` as defined **in** the `Scrum Guide`. They do this by helping everyone **understand** `Scrum theory` and practice, both **within** the `Scrum Team` **and** the `organization`.

The Scrum Master is **accountable for** the Scrum Team’s `effectiveness`. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to **improve** its practices, within the `Scrum framework`.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who **serve** the `Scrum Team` **and** the larger `organization`.

The Scrum Master serves the **Scrum Team** in several ways, including:

- **Coaching** the team members in `self-management` and `cross-functionality`;

- **Helping** the Scrum Team focus on `creating` high-value `Increments` that meet the **Definition of Done**;

- **Causing** the `removal` of **impediments** to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,

- **Ensuring** that all `Scrum events` take place and **are** `positive`, `productive`, and kept **within** the `timebox`.

The Scrum Master serves the **Product Owner** in several ways, including:

- Helping **find** `techniques` for effective **Product Goal** `definition` and **Product Backlog** `management`;

- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for `clear` **Product Backlog items**;

- Helping establish **empirical** `product planning` for a **complex** `environment`; and,

- Facilitating **stakeholder** `collaboration` as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the **organization** in several ways, including:

- Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its `Scrum` **adoption**;

- Planning and advising `Scrum` **implementations** within the organization;

- **Helping** employees and stakeholders `understand` and enact an `empirical` **approach** for `complex` **work**; and,

- `Removing` **barriers between** `stakeholders` **and** `Scrum Teams`.
