**Scrum** *is* `free` and offered in this Guide. The Scrum **framework**, as outlined herein, *is* `immutable`. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the **result** *is* `not Scrum`. Scrum **exists** only *in its* `entirety` and **functions** well *as a* `container` for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

> Definition of Immutable: **Something** that `cannot change` or alter **after** it is `created` or defined.
