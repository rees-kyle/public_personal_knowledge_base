In mathematics, a network model refers to a general concept based on a [[graph|study.fields.mathematics.theories.graph.graphs]]. It is an `application of graph theory` and is used for theoretical analysis of various systems.

1. Purpose and Application: In mathematics, network models are primarily used to represent and study the relationships and connections between different elements in various real-world systems. They are employed in graph theory to analyze properties of networks, understand connectivity, paths, cycles, and other graph-related concepts. The focus is on theoretical analysis and understanding the structure and properties of networks.

2. Representation: In mathematical network models, nodes and edges typically represent abstract elements and their connections, and the relationships can be of various types, not limited to physical connections.

3. Layers and Protocols: Mathematical network models do not have layers or protocols, as they are more general and abstract representations of networks. Layers and protocols can be found in [computer network models](../../Computing/notes/networking.models.md).

4. Emphasis on Practical Implementation: Mathematical network models are focused on theoretical aspects and are not concerned with the practical implementation of network technologies. [Computer network models](../../Computing/notes/networking.models.md) are focused on practical implementation.
