Key elements of mathematics include:

1. **Arithmetic:** The basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division used for calculations involving numbers.

2. **Algebra:** The study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating them to solve equations and represent relationships between variables.

3. **Geometry:** The study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space, including points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

4. **Calculus:** The branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. It includes concepts like derivatives and integrals.

5. **Statistics:** The collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Statistics is essential for drawing conclusions from data and making informed decisions.

6. **Probability:** The study of randomness and uncertainty, and the likelihood of events occurring.

7. **Number Theory:** The study of integers and their properties, including prime numbers, divisibility, and mathematical relationships.
