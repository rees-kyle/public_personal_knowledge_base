Mathematical graphs can be used to model a wide range of situations and problems into a [[graph theory model|study.fields.mathematics.theories.graph.theory-models]]. They have applications in various areas, including computer science, operations research, social sciences, biology, physics, and many others.

Graph theory provides a rich framework for analyzing the properties and behaviors of various systems and networks. Mathematicians and researchers use graph theory to solve problems related to optimization, network flows, graph coloring, graph embeddings, and much more. Additionally, the study of graph algorithms and properties is essential in solving computational problems efficiently and understanding complex relationships in various domains.
