In mathematics, theories refer to formal systems of axioms, definitions, and logical rules that provide a foundation for studying specific branches of mathematics. These theories establish a coherent framework for reasoning and proving mathematical statements, theorems, and properties. Some of the key theories in mathematics include:

---

1. **Set Theory:** Set theory is a fundamental theory that deals with the study of sets, which are collections of objects. It provides the foundation for the rest of mathematics and addresses concepts like unions, intersections, subsets, and the cardinality of sets.

2. **Number Theory:** Number theory focuses on the properties and relationships of integers. It covers topics like prime numbers, divisibility, modular arithmetic, and Diophantine equations.

3. **Algebraic Theory:** Algebraic theories include various branches of algebra, such as linear algebra, abstract algebra, and group theory. They study the properties of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and vector spaces.

4. **Calculus:** Calculus is a theory that deals with the study of continuous change and motion. It includes differential calculus, which examines rates of change and slopes, and integral calculus, which deals with areas and accumulation.

5. **Geometry:** Geometry is a theory that studies the properties and relationships of shapes and spaces. It includes Euclidean geometry, which deals with flat surfaces, and non-Euclidean geometries, which explore curved surfaces.

6. **Probability Theory:** Probability theory focuses on the study of uncertainty and randomness. It provides a mathematical foundation for understanding the likelihood of events and statistical reasoning.

7. **Logic:** Logic is a foundational theory that deals with the study of formal reasoning and valid argumentation. It is used as a basis for the development of other mathematical theories and helps establish the rules of mathematical proof.

8. **Graph Theory:** Graph theory is a theory that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between vertices). It is widely used in various applications, including computer science, communication networks, and optimization problems.

These are just a few examples of theories in mathematics, and within each theory, there are many subfields and specialized areas of study. Mathematicians continuously explore and develop new theories to expand our understanding of mathematical concepts and their applications.
