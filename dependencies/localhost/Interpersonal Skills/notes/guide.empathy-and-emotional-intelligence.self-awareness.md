Self-awareness **involves** `recognizing` **your** `own emotions` `and understanding` `how they influence` **your** `thoughts`, `behaviors`, `and interactions` `with others`. Self-awareness **is** `the foundation of` `emotional intelligence`. It **enables you** `to identify` **your** `emotional triggers`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `and` **how these aspects affect your** `reactions` **in different situations**. **By being self-aware**, **you can** `better manage` **your** `emotions`, `make` `more thoughtful` `decisions`, `and improve` **your** `relationships`, **as you are more attuned to how your feelings impact your behavior and the environment around you**.
