`Assertiveness` is a key interpersonal skill that **involves** `expressing` `your thoughts`, `feelings`, `and beliefs in` `an open`, `honest`, `and respectful way`. It is **essential** `for building` **healthy** `relationships`, `managing conflict`, `and achieving` `personal goals` `without` `being overly passive` `or aggressive`. **Here’s how you can set boundaries effectively within assertiveness**:

Boundaries **are** `personal limits` `that define` `what you are comfortable with` `and how you want others to treat you`. **They** `help protect` **your** `physical`, `emotional`, `and mental well-being` `by making it clear` `what is acceptable` `and what is not`.

#
Passive-aggressive `behavior` **refers to** `indirectly expressing` `negative feelings or resentment` **instead of openly addressing them**. It typically **involves** `actions` **like** `procrastination`, **giving someone the** `silent treatment`, **or making** `sarcastic comments`, **rather than confronting the issue directly**. It’s **a way of** `avoiding confrontation` `while still expressing` `anger or frustration`.

### **Setting Boundaries**
1. **Know Your Limits**: `Understand` **your** `emotional`, `physical`, **and** `mental` `limits`. `Identify` **what you are** `comfortable` **with** `and` **what is** `unacceptable` **to you**.

2. **Be Clear and Direct**: When setting boundaries, `express` **your** `needs in` `a clear and straightforward` `manner`. `Avoid` `vague statements` and be specific about what you are comfortable with or not.

   - **Example: “I need some time to focus on my work, so I can't take calls during the day.”**

3. **Use “I” Statements**: This `reduces` `the chances of` `the other person` `becoming defensive` `and promotes` `open communication`. `Instead of` `blaming or accusing`, `express` `how you feel` `or what you need`.

   - **Example: “I feel overwhelmed when I’m asked to do things outside of my work hours. I need to keep my evenings free for personal time.”**

4. **Be Consistent**: **Setting boundaries once is not enough**. `Reinforce` **them** `regularly` `and be firm` `when someone tries to overstep`. **Consistency** `helps others understand` **that you respect your own limits**.

5. **Practice Self-Respect**: `Value` **your** `own needs and desires`. Understand that `setting boundaries is` **a form of** `self-care`, and **it’s** `not selfish` `to prioritize` `your well-being`.

6. **Be Ready for Pushback**: Sometimes, `others` `may not` **immediately** `respect your boundaries`. **Be prepared to** `politely but firmly` `repeat them` **when necessary**.

7. **Stay Calm and Respectful**: `Assertivenes is` `not` **about** `being confrontational`. **You can** `remain calm`, `respectful`, `and polite` `while still setting` `clear boundaries`.

   - **Example: “I understand that you're asking for help, but I need to focus on my priorities right now. Let’s discuss this after my meeting.”**
