Empathy **is** `the ability` `to understand and share` `the feelings of` `another person`. It **involves** `recognizing` `emotions in` `others`, `listening actively`, and `responding in` **a way that shows** `compassion and understanding`. Empathy is **essential** `for building trust` `and maintaining positive relationships`, as it **allows for** `deeper connections` `and fosters a supportive environment`. **By showing empathy**, **individuals demonstrate that they** `value` `others' perspectives and experiences`, which **can lead to** `more effective` `communication and collaboration`.
